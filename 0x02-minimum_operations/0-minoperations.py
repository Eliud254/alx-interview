"""
A method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in
exactly n H characters in the file.

Prototype: def minOperations(n)
Returns an integer
If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH =>
Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
