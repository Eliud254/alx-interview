# Lockboxes

## Algorithm

### Overview
This project aims to develop an algorithm in Python to efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. It involves applying various key concepts in computer science and Python programming to devise an optimal solution.

### Concepts Needed
#### Lists and List Manipulation:
- Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
  - [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

#### Graph Theory Basics:
- Knowledge of graph theory, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search, can be beneficial.
  - [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
  
#### Algorithmic Complexity:
- Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is essential for writing efficient algorithms.
  - [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/)

#### Recursion:
- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
  - [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

#### Queue and Stack:
- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing BFS or DFS algorithms to traverse through the keys and boxes.
  - [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-queue-python-using-module-queue/)

#### Set Operations:
- Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
  - [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)
